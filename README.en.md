# Esfer@ Acta Extractor

A Python tool to extract and process grade records from Esfer@'s PDF grade reports. The tool parses PDF tables, processes student grades, and generates two types of Excel files:
1. A detailed file with all RA (Learning Achievement) and MP (Professional Module) grades.
2. A summary report for each MP with student grades and a clear results overview.

## Features

### PDF Processing
- Automatic extraction of grade reports from PDF files
- Intelligent processing of student names and grades
- Automatic identification of MPs with Workplace Training (EM) hours

### Detailed Excel File
- Comprehensive view of all RA and MP grades
- Clear organization by student and MP
- Conditional formatting for better visualization
- Cell protection with password "edita'm"
- Built-in formulas for automatic calculations

### Grade Summary
- Consolidated view of grades for each MP
- Different number formats for Type A (2 decimals) and Type B (integer) MPs
- Built-in legend explaining MP types
- Alternating row colors for better readability
- Data validation to ensure correct values
- Professional formatting ready for printing

## Requirements

- Docker (recommended)
- Python 3.9+ (if running locally)
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation & Usage

### Using Docker (Recommended)

**Important**: Place your Esfer@ PDF file in the root folder of the project before running any Docker commands.

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t esfera-acta-extractor .
```

2. You have two options to run the container:

   a. Direct execution:
   ```bash
   docker run -v $(pwd):/app esfera-acta-extractor python esfera-acta-extractor.py
   ```

   b. Interactive mode (recommended for debugging or multiple files):
   ```bash
   docker run --rm -it \
     -v "$(pwd)":/data \
     -w /data \
     esfera-acta-extractor
   ```
   Once inside the container, you can run:
   ```bash
   python esfera-acta-extractor.py
   ```
   To exit the interactive shell, simply type:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

**Note**: The script will:
- Look for PDF files in the `01_source_pdfs` directory
- Process each PDF file individually
- Generate Excel output files in the `02_extracted_data` directory
- Name each output file based on the group code found in its corresponding PDF
- Skip any files that are not PDFs or cannot be processed
- Continue processing remaining files even if some fail

3. Container cleanup:
   - For interactive mode (`--rm` flag): Container is automatically removed upon exit
   - For background processes: Stop the container with:
   ```bash
   docker stop $(docker ps -q --filter ancestor=esfera-acta-extractor)
   ```

**Note**: The script will:
- Look for the PDF file in the current directory
- Generate the Excel output file in the same directory
- Name the output file based on the group code found in the PDF

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Marcos-A/esfera-acta-extractor.git
cd esfera-acta-extractor
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python esfera-acta-extractor.py
```

## Input/Output

### Input
- PDF file from Esfer@ containing grade tables
- File should include "Codi del grup" field in the first page
- Expected grade formats: A#, PDT, EP, NA

### Output
- Excel file named with the group code (e.g., `CFPM_AG10101.xlsx`)
- Contains:
  - Student names
  - RA grades grouped by MP
  - 3 empty columns after MPs with EM entries (labeled as CENTRE, EMPRESA, MP)
  - 1 empty column after regular MPs (labeled as MP)

## Development

The project uses:
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `pdfplumber` for PDF parsing
- `openpyxl` for Excel file generation
- `tabulate` for development/debugging output
